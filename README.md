**Trivia Game**

This Python code implements a trivia game that can be played by multiple players. Questions are loaded from a JSON file and can be categorized by difficulty.

**How to Play**

1.  Install the required libraries:
    - `json`
    - `random`
    - `argparse`
2.  Create a JSON file containing trivia questions. Each question should have the following properties:
    - `question`: The text of the question.
    - `options`: A dictionary where the keys are answer choices (letters or numbers) and the values are the text of the answer choices.
    - `correct_answer`: The key from the `options` dictionary corresponding to the correct answer.
    - `category`: The category of the question (e.g., history, science).
    - `difficulty`: The difficulty of the question (e.g., easy, medium, hard).
3.  Run the script using the following command:

```bash
python trivia_game.py <questions_file.json> <number_of_players>
```

**Example Usage**

```bash
python trivia_game.py trivia_questions.json 2
```

This command will run the trivia game using the questions in `trivia_questions.json` and allow two players to compete.

**Example JSON File**

```json
[
  {
    "question": "What is the capital of France?",
    "options": {
      "a": "London",
      "b": "Paris",
      "c": "Berlin"
    },
    "correct_answer": "b",
    "category": "geography",
    "difficulty": "easy"
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the scientific name for a human?",
    "options": {
      "a": "Homo sapiens",
      "b": "Australopithecus afarensis",
      "c": "Tyrannosaurus rex"
    },
    "correct_answer": "a",
    "category": "science",
    "difficulty": "medium"
  }
]
```
 
This is a basic example, you can extend it further with features like:

* Keeping track of high scores.
* Timers for answering questions.
* Adding sound effects.
